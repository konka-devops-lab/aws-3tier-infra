# userdata was executes during the creation of the instance it does not require ssh access
# when we are using null_resource for userdata execution it requires ssh access


# userdata runs inside the EC2 at launch time and does not need SSH access. 
# But null_resource with remote-exec connects from Terraform using SSH, so it needs port 22 open, key pair, and public access. 
# Thatâ€™s why user_data is more reliable and preferred for initial configuration during provisioning.
